# Overview

As a software engineer, I'm always seeking opportunities to deepen my understanding of fundamental programming concepts and improve my technical skills.

The software I’ve created is a simple yet classic “Hello World” program, reinforcing the basic principles of software development—understanding syntax, structure, and output.

The purpose of creating this software is to strengthen my ability to write clean, efficient code while incorporating personal creativity into even the most basic programs.

# Development Environment

Tools that I used 

- Visual Studio Code: My primary code editor.

- Git: For version control.

- GitHub: To host the project and ensure that each module I work on has a dedicated repository.

I used JavaScript as the programming language for this project. It’s a versatile language, known for its simplicity in small projects like this one, while also offering powerful capabilities for building complex applications.

Hours spent: 1 hour
